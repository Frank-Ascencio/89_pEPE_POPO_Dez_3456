                Twelve years ago, my father came to America to build a better life for our family. Despite being an electrical engineer, it was hard for him to find work as a professional because he couldnâ€™t speak English. We built Polydot, a real-time translation service that makes anyone a native English speaker.

                If you are a programmer in Mexico who cant speak English, you can get a job as a remote employee at Google speaking perfect English.
                
                How? Polydot connects to zoom and translates everything you say in real time and in your own voice. So, when you speak Spanish everyone will hear you in English.
                
                We started just 35 days ago. Since then, weve built an English to Spanish prototype for desktop. Next we want to do three things: 1 get a small set of users to perfect our prototype, 2) expand to 6 languages which will be able to cover 64% of programmers in outside the US, and 3) launch on iPhone and Android.
                
                We charge $20/month and are targeting the 900 million knowledge workers outside the US, starting with programmers.
                
                We are Polydot and we make everyone a native English speaker.
